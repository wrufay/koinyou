## What is this?

koinYOU is a Bible app built for community. There are plenty of Bible apps out there, but most feel impersonal. This one is about doing faith *with* people — search verses, save the ones that resonate, share them with friends, and pray for each other.

## Why I made this

I wanted to build something meaningful. Not for profit, not for clout — just something that might actually help people connect with Scripture and with each other.

There's something special about reading the same verse your friend is reading, or knowing someone prayed for you today. That's the goal here.

## Features

- **Verse Search** — Find any verse instantly (supports formats like "1 Corinthians 13:4-7")
- **Save Verses** — Keep the ones that matter to you
- **Send to Friends** — Share verses with people you care about
- **Prayer Wall** — Post prayers, pray for others
- **Devotions** — Read and share what God's teaching you

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express, Node.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Auth**: Google OAuth
- **Hosting**: Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend)

## Running Locally

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/koinyou.git

# Frontend
npm install
npm run dev

# Backend (in another terminal)
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

You'll need a `.env` file with your MongoDB URI, Google OAuth credentials, etc.

## Contributing

If you want to help make this better, PRs are welcome.

## A Note

This isn't a startup. I'm not trying to monetize this or turn it into a business. It's just a project made for anyone who wants to grow closer to God and to each other.

If even one person feels less alone in their faith because of this app, that's enough.
