## What is this?

koinYOU is a Bible app built for community. Search for any verse, save the ones that stick with you, and share them with friends. There's also a prayer wall where you can post prayers and lift others up, plus a space for devotions.

Most Bible apps feel like you're reading alone. This one's different — it's about doing faith *with* people.

## Features

- **Verse Search** — Find any verse instantly (try "John 3:16" or "1 Corinthians 13:4-7")
- **Save Verses** — Build your personal collection
- **Send to Friends** — Share a verse with someone who needs it
- **Prayer Wall** — Post prayers, pray for others
- **Devotions** — Share what God's been teaching you

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express, Node.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Auth**: Google OAuth
- **Hosting**: Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend)

## Running Locally

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/koinyou.git

# Frontend
npm install
npm run dev

# Backend (in another terminal)
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

You'll need a `.env` file with your MongoDB URI, Google OAuth credentials, etc.
